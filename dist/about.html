      <span class="text-primary">About</span> Cynthia Cheatham Law
    </h1>
    <p>Cynthia Cheatham’s practice focuses on difficult family law cases, many involving “protective parents,” i.e. parents who are victims of domestic violence or whose children are victims of child abuse, or both. Cynthia’s first “protective parent” case involved a family member and Cynthia was able to turn a devastating family court decision into a complete victory for the parent. To this end, Ms. Cheatham has consulted with, and used, experts throughout the country in the field of interpersonal violence and trauma.</p>
    <p>Cynthia also handles appeals, in addition to trial work and strives to obtain “amicus briefs” (friend of the court) from nationally recognized organizations such as the Leadership Council, DVLEAP, and Child Justice.</p>

            After going through two attorneys who pretty much said our case was hopeless... Cynthia came along and gave a spark of life to us that turned into a fire that could not be contained. She was not afraid to stand up to the judges and fight for what she knew to be an injustice. We will forever be grateful for her relentless fight for us. Should you need an attorney, you will not find a better one than Cynthia Cheatham! She is awesome!
